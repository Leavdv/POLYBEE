<h2> Project description </h2>

The objective of this project is to provide remote monitoring of bee colonies (hives) in order to improve crop management. More precisely, our part deals with the development of a power supply board for internal modules with sensors. We must therefore be able to recharge LiFe batteries thanks to a photovoltaic panel in order to manage the autonomy of each hive as well as possible. We must also make a map for the link between the data received by each sensor in the apiary*. What we call the Gateway is the card that will send all values to a remotely searchable database.

*The grouping of hives is called an apiary.
